# Data_visualization
The project demonstrates data visualization techniques using python libraries Matplotlib and seaborn. 
As Data visualization is a key tool for data analysis and communication, it forms a key preprocessing layer employed in machine learning algorithms.
# Matplotlib 
A foundational Python library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
# Seaborn 
A statistical data visualization library based on Matplotlib that makes attractive and informative plots simple. 
# SVContour plot  
It is a key method to visually seperate data points into different classes to used in context of Support Vector Machines.
